# Alexa-Boilerplate

> Forked from [singledigit/alexa-skill-skeleton](https://github.com/singledigit/alexa-skill-skeleton)

This is a starter package to create alexa skills using ES6 and pre-transpiling with babel.

## To Use

1. Clone This repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp build`. This will create a file called `package.zip` in the root of your project.
4. Upload `package.zip` to your Lambda.
5. Edit `action` files as needed to make it your own.

## Files

#### `index.js`
This is the base file that is loaded when the Lambda first loads. This file determines the Request type and routes accordingly.

#### `action-launch-request.js`
Ths page handles the LaunchRequest which is generally a base welcome and a prompt for more info from the user to help define the intent.

#### `action-intent-request.js`
When an intent is determined, this page is loaded and handles the intent.

#### `action-session-end-request.js`
Responsible for clearing the session and cleaning up.

#### `response-model.js`
Provides a model for a standard request. This is a good place to insert default values.

#### `utilities.js`
Provides global functions for the application.

#### `api-client.js`
Helpful if this app needs to make a call to a rest API, which the skeleton example does.
